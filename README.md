# NYC Taxi Industry Data Analysis

## Introduction and Background

### Problem Statement
The taxi industry in New York City faces significant challenges in optimizing fare pricing, understanding customer behavior, and predicting demand. Several factors, including time of day, location, trip distance, and external events, substantially impact fare amounts and driver earnings. A detailed analysis of these factors is necessary to uncover trends and optimize operations effectively.

### Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Identify key factors influencing taxi fares**:
   - Explore relationships between fare amounts, tip amounts, trip distance, time of day, pick-up and drop-off locations, and other relevant features.

2. **Develop a predictive model for taxi fares**:
   - Create a model to estimate taxi fares based on the identified factors. This can assist:
     - **Drivers**: Estimate potential earnings for a trip.
     - **Customers**: Plan and anticipate the total cost of a taxi ride.

3. **Discover actionable insights**:
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to:
     - Identify the busiest times of day.
     - Calculate the average total cost at different times.
     - Analyze which months of the year have the highest speeds.
   - Use insights to suggest:
     - Discounts by taxi companies.
     - Precautionary messages for drivers to slow down.
